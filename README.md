==# Intro
This lab has been created for RH Summit 2023 Compliance-as-code interactive session by [Tommer Amber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommeramber/?originalSubdomain=il). 

This session provides a demonstration of how to manage compliance policies for multiple Kubernetes clusters across disciplines, including configuration management, image vulnerability detection, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and cluster misconfiguration mutation. During this session, youâ€™ll get an overview of how to use with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Kyverno to:

* Design end-to-end solutions for multicloud environments.
* Manage Red Hat OpenShift (Kubernetes) clusters using GitOps.
* Implement security best practices in Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes.
* Deploy and manage popular open source tools for microservices and security.

   1.1. Create SSH Key on you machine
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   
   1.2. Copy the public key and create new repo SSH key here - https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
   
   1.3. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   export USERNAME=<YOUR_GIT_REPO_USERNAME>
   git clone git@github.com:$USERNAME/Compliance-As-Code.git
   cd Compliance-As-Code
   export BASE=$(pwd)
   ```

   1.4. Change the Playbook to point to your git forked repo
   ```bash
   sed -i "s,tommeramber,$USERNAME,g" Part-0-Ansible-Playbook/playbook.yaml
   ```

2. Login to Hub cluster from your local machine
3. [Register/Import or provision Openshift clusters to ACM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DId5fVzBv7E)
4. Run the Ansible playbook - [Automation Explainer](Part-0-Ansible-Playbook/README.md)
```bash
cd Part-0-Ansible-Playbook
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
```

5. Login to the new ArgoCD instance and see that (almost) everything is ready

6. Label the managed clusters in ACM to get security policies by ACM

## How everything is installed on the managed clusters?
The ArgoCD is synced with our Git Repo, and it deploys ACM policies on ACM, they are based on ACM's built-in Governance feature.

ACM Policies defines for ACM what is the desired state of K8s objects on the managed clusters (or the Hub itself) and in case they are adsent - it (ACM) will create them on the relevant cluster. 

ACM relies on managed clusters labels to decide which policy should be installed on which cluster.

By integrate kyverno policies inside ACM policies, ACM deploys the kyverno policies compliance policies on the managed clusters that has kyverno installed.

## So what's up with all the "app-of-apps"?
Our Ansible Automation "manually" applyed the initial [app-of-apps YAML file](../Part-0-Ansible-Playbook/roles/deploy-app-of-apps/yamls/app.yaml) on our ACM Openshift-GitOps namespace.

This YAML points our ArgoCD instance to look at this Helm Chart directory in the git repo (in your case it's the forked repo), and from that point forward ArgoCD will apply all the other YAMLs for us.

This Helm Chart directory actually holds `ArgoCD Applications` & `ApplicationSets`, that once applied (by our ArgoCD itself after the initial app-of-apps creation by the Ansible Automation) - will generate all the YAMLs in the [Part-2-Compliance-as-GitOps](../Part-2-Compliance-as-GitOps/) directory one by one:
